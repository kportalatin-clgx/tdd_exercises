# tdd_exercises

## Overview

This repository contains Test-Driven Development (TDD) practice exercises and their solutions. Each exercise is contained in its own sub-package of the same name.  Package pages contain detailed explanations of each exercise.

### TDD Guidelines

  * Try not to read ahead.
  * Do one task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.
  * Only test for correct inputs. There is no need to test for invalid inputs.
